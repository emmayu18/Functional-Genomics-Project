# Functional Genomics Project
This is my final project for the Function Genomics course at Northwestern University. </p>
I performed two comparative gene expression analysis, over-representation analysis (ORA) and Gene Set Expression Analysis (GSEA), on juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) data.

## Objective
* 

## Skills Displayed in This Project
* Jupyter notebook, python
* Data cleaning/wrangling
* Genetic data analysis
* Data visualization using `matplotlib`
* HTML CSS design
* Scientific communication 

## File Outline
`data/`: folder containing tsv files for the datasets used in the project</p>
`pathways/`: folder containing txt files for the cell signaling pathways explored in the project</p>
`final_project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook file containing the report</p>
`custom.css`: css file used to customize the HTML output file from `final_project.ipynb`</p>
`final_project.html`: HTML output file from `final_project.ipynb`</p>


## How to Use
If you want to view the report in a more user friendly platform, check out the `final_project.html` file.</p>
If you want to play around with my code, feel free to download the `final_project.ipynb` file. You also need to download the data and pathway files located in the `data/` and `pathway/` folders.
