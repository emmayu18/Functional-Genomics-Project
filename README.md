# Functional-Genomics-Project
This is my final project for the Function Genomics course at Northwestern University. 

## Objective
* 

## Skills Displayed in This Project
* Jupyter notebook, python
* Data cleaning/wrangling
* Genetic data analysis
* Data visualization using matplotlib
* Scientific communication 
* HTML CSS design

## File Outline
`data/`: folder containing tsv files for the datasets used in the project
`pathways/`: folder containing txt files for the cell signaling pathways explored in the project
`final_project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook file containing the report
`custom.css`: css file used to customize the HTML output file from `final_project.ipynb` 
`final_project.html`: HTML output file from `final_project.ipynb` 


## How to Use
If you want to view the report in a more user friendly platform, check out the `final_project.html` file. 
If you want to play around with my code, feel free to download the `final_project.ipynb` file. You also need to download the data and pathway files located in the `data/` and `pathway/` folders.
