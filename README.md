# Functional Genomics Project
This is my final project for the Function Genomics course at Northwestern University. </p>
https://emmayu18.github.io/Functional-Genomics-Project/ </p>
I performed two comparative gene expression analyses, over-representation analysis (ORA) and Gene Set Expression Analysis (GSEA), on juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) data. </p>
Dataset: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEOD-112057/Results

## Objective
* Test whether certain signaling pathways are overexpressed in JIA and IBD
* Compare results to the findings from the data source publication
* Explore different types of genetic expression analyses
* Visualize genetic expression data and analysis results
* Demonstrate proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using Python

## Skills Displayed in This Project
* Jupyter notebook, Python
* Data wrangling
* Genetic data analysis
* Data visualization using `matplotlib`
* HTML CSS design
* Scientific communication 

## File Outline
`data/`: folder containing tsv files for the datasets used in the project </p>
`docs/`: folder containing the report HTML file hosted on GitHub Pages
`pathways/`: folder containing txt files containing the genes in each cell signaling pathway explored in the project </p>
`final_project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook file containing the report </p>
`custom.css`: css file used to customize the HTML output file from `final_project.ipynb` </p>

## How to Use
If you want to view the report in a more user friendly format, check out the report on https://emmayu18.github.io/Functional-Genomics-Project/. </p>
If you want to play around with my code, feel free to download the `final_project.ipynb` file. You also need to download the data and pathway files located in the `data/` and `pathway/` folders.
